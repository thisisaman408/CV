<!--  i vs em, em basically emphaised the text
  between it's tags, + it also make them italic, so 
  that's why it's practice to use em instead of i
  
  
  similar for b vs strong, b is used for bold text,
  but strong is used for bold text that is also
  important, so it's better to use strong instead of b
  -strong means strong importance, b means bold text- -



  The <details> tag in HTML is used to create a collapsible section that users can open and close to reveal more information. It's commonly used when you want to hide additional content unless the user actively chooses to view it. When clicked, the section expands to show the content inside it.

Hereâ€™s a basic example:

html
Copy code
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
  <p>This is the hidden content that is revealed when you click "More details".</p>
</details>
Key Features:
<summary>: This tag defines a visible heading for the collapsible section. Itâ€™s the part that users click to expand or collapse the content.
By default, the section is collapsed until the user clicks the summary.
You can use any HTML content inside the <details> tag, such as text, images, or even other HTML elements.
Example in action:
html
Copy code
<details>
  <summary>Click to view details</summary>
  <p>Here is the hidden content that will be revealed when you click the summary.</p>
</details>
Behavior:
When clicked, the summary toggles between hiding and showing the content.
You can style it with CSS to change its appearance.
